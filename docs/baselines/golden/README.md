# Golden Baselines — Deepgram and OpenAI

This directory centralizes stable references for golden baselines used in regressions and rule files across IDEs. Use these when guiding testing, RCA, or comparing against working behavior.

- Deepgram Golden Baseline: see `deepgram.md`
- OpenAI Realtime Golden Baseline: see `openai.md`

These pages point to canonical logs and analyses captured under `logs/remote/` and to summary documents at the repo root. Prefer these references over ad-hoc dated paths in prompts and rules.
